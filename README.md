## Our experience
I found that creating the visual representations of the database, web flow and RESTful routes helped keep my project organised.
Having a very clear structure and end goal in mind meant I was never stuck on what to do next.

Key learning:
- Plan everything

Challenges:
- CSS stylings (not with Sam around)
- PSQL (except for Kevin)
- Displaying specific pages with specific paths
